description: This is an example YAML that genrates between 50-100 chests with 10 goal items, and therefore 40-90 junk items

APBot:
  # Number of regions to generate, and number of chests per region
  num_regions: 10
  min_chests_per_region: 5
  max_chests_per_region: 10

  # Time between checks, in seconds
  min_time_between_checks: 
  max_time_between_checks: 10

  # Number of goal items to generate that are required to win
  # Must be less than the number of chests
  num_goal_items: 10
